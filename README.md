# datascience-project

Here's why a stock price tracker is a good topic for a data science project:

Real-world application: Stock prices are a valuable piece of information for investors and anyone interested in the financial markets.

Data availability: Stock price data is readily available through various APIs and online sources.

Variety of analysis opportunities: You can analyze historical trends, predict future prices (be cautious!), compare different stocks, and build visualizations.

Learning different skills: This project will allow you to practice data acquisition, data cleaning, analysis, and potentially visualization techniques.


Concepts Used in the Code
The code utilizes several data science concepts:

API access: You use the requests library to interact with the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve stock price data.

Data manipulation: Libraries like pandas help you process and organize the received data (JSON format) into a structured format (DataFrame) for further analysis.

Data visualization (optional): While not explicitly shown, libraries like matplotlib.pyplot can be used to create charts and graphs to visualize your findings.


Libraries Used and Why
Here's a breakdown of the libraries used in the code and their purpose:

requests: Used to make HTTP requests to the Alpha Vantage API.

pandas: Used to manipulate and analyze data stored in a DataFrame format.

yfinance (optional): While not used in the provided code snippet, yfinance is another popular library for retrieving stock data. You can choose either yfinance or requests with the Alpha Vantage API depending on your preference.

matplotlib.pyplot (optional): Used for creating visualizations like plots and charts to represent your data.
This code provides a solid foundation for a stock price tracker project.
